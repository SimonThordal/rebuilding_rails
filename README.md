# rebuilding_rails
Small homebrewed web framework, based off of Rails and the excellent [Rebuilding Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/) book. Going off Rack we add 
* A tiny ORM, complete with a SQL database
* Controllers that share instance variables with views
* View templating
* Autoloading
* Old style routes, that just look for a controller with the correct name and method
* Helper classes

You could technically create a website using this, but why would you? But if you want to get a peek behind some of the magic in a modern web framework then I can absolutely recommend [Rebuilding Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/).
